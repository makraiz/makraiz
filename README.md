- 💻 I've built full-stack automation & data wiping software/hardware solutions for local e-waste recyclers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game development, with a particular interest in procedural generation.
- 📖 I know Rust, C++/Qt, C#, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python, BASH, and am open to learning others.
